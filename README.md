I’m @WTonon (call me Walter, please).

I’m interested in complex image processing, like IA (Genetic expressions nd algorithms (GP+GA), Neural Networks (NN - RBF, Khonen and MLP/BP), Numerical Transforms, Pattern Recognition (PR) Deconvolution and signal processing - all in C/C++.

I’m currently learning how to use all CPUs cores to do a cluster programming, improving the proccessing capacity.

I’m looking to collaborate on numerical processing.

How to reach me: Send a email to wtonon@gmail.com.

Important: This developments are for my hobby to improve my telescope images (I love astronomy).
